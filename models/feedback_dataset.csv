No Negative,Negative
 Initial receptionist very functional told us off for looking near her computer Hotel undergoing renovation no prior knowledge of this other than told entrance moved had to walk through redecorating area to access room no fitness available on site ,Negative
 That the reciption is very small and connected to bar which made us confuse when we reached and we did not know where to check in Other than that everything was perfect best of luck ,Negative
 I expected To have a kettle and coffee tea in the room as we normally always have in the rooms The second bed was not comfortable too low postured ,Negative
 The hallway was shocking Construction everywhere Two elevators took us to a second building which was connected with the hotel The hallway in this part was old and did not match the style of the entrance at all The room was old scratches everywhere The Airconditioning was old and very loud but not working properly Unfortunately their was no button to witch it of because the regulation was broken ,Negative
 We had booked two different rooms and specified few weeks in advance that we wanted the rooms next to each other but still got rooms far from each other No shampoo or other stuff in the bathrooms Old and almost molding hotel rooms Nowhere to sit apart from your bed when you have visitors Poor AC stank very badly and was almost broken ,Negative
 Bad chose vor value money Around ight clubs low rates Too far to center by walk Lasy staff on reseption Poor furniture My rate of this place is 3 ,Negative
 we arrived late at night and needed some food the area where the hotel was situated wasn t the nicest we ate at a nearby shopping centre which wasn t very nice I am glad I was with my husband as well as my mother in law as the area and the locals made me feel intimidated ,Negative
 Unfortunately there was big building works going on in the hotel and started early in morning with what sounded like pneumatic dills and hammers bit picky but there wasn t much shelf space in bathroom to put cosmetic items The garden view as described was a courtyard that had a glass roof of the shopping centre in the centre with a small width between the roof and hotel walls ,Negative
 The hotel is undergoing refurbishment of the restaurant and arrangements were made to have breakfast in a nearby restaurant on our first morning The refurbished restaurant was declared ready for the next day this wasn t quite right because the lighting was not yes finished which made the place very dark and gloomy the very opposite condition for a bright start to a new day I understand perfectly that refurbishment is necessary and needs to be done with as little disruption to occupancy levels but due consideration must be given to the inconvenience to guests a mere apology is mean Good customer relations are paramount and a convincing gesture of regret is always better supporte with a discount of sorts When will hotels ever learn that repeat business is the key ,Negative
 It does not really get to 4 star marking if you have heavy bags there is a problem getting down the stairs to the reception The charge of 14 euros per breakfast is really too much for the offered variety ,Negative
 Nothing at all ,Negative
 Breakfast is 14 per person and is not particularly good Air conditioning was broken for the full duration of our stay 4 nights and the only blankets available were heavy We asked for lighter sheets but never got them,Negative
 It is not as central as it sounded and the hotel itself is very oddly structured so you can be quite a distance away from the elevators or the desk for assistance My hope was that would make it more quiet but really the noise just echoes through the long hallways The bed was two twin beds pushed together which separated a couple of times during the night so my husband just about fell through I just checked my card and there has been an additional charge that I didn t sign for nor was there anything used at the hotel or in the room ,Negative
 It s not really the comfort of a 4 star hotel I booked here because it had a discount 59 per night otherwise the price was 150 per night The hotel is not worth 150 night ,Negative
 No tea or coffee making facilities but as there was no kettle as stated it didn t really matter nor were there any slippers as stated TV did not work on whole floor for 2 days phone did not work at all which we reported Poor selection mini bar and expensive Bathroom only included fixed squeezy soap containers for shower and basin and no flannel no hair shampoo No English breakfast tea in restaurant only herbal or Earl Grey so had to have coffee Location for us a bit to far from City centre although underground across the road cheap ticket and 1 change gets you there in 10 12 mins Noisy air conditioning had to turn off at night For these reasons would not class it 4 star ,Negative
 Perhaps the location was a little far out of the city but the underground was nearby and easy to use The bus was also a very short distance from the hotel We don t mind walking so it didn t present a problem for us 20 30 minutes walk into the heart of Vienna depending on personal walking speed ,Negative
 The overall room amenities were more for a 3 star hotel room at top floor was very small furniture was old very little space for clothes painting on the walls was dirty in some places probably form other tourists trying to accommodate the luggage in such a small room No kettle coffee or tea facilities like in other 4 star hotels we ve been Although the cleaning lady visited our room every day to change the towels the wooden floor was always dirty full of dust ,Negative
 The reception staff were efficient but not very friendly unlike the cleaning lady on our floor I was concerned about security as the reception was down steps from entrance and staff did not always sit at desk The door and access to all floors was easily accessible from the road this is presumably why a voucher system operated for breakfast We had no problems though The cable tv only worked on two days ,Negative
 The location for breakfast was a bit inconvenient a walk through the side door into the shopping centre where an outside firm provided breakfasts to guests and the general public The breakfast wasn t great particularly the look of the fried eggs the word cremated springs to mind This may be a temporary measure while the hotel is getting its own breakfast room refurbished because we spotted a room with a Breakfast sign on it that was closed up ,Negative
 It s more 3 star city hotel breakfast was terrible you should go outside the hotel for breakfast very noisy outside not worth of that money ,Negative
 Room temperature was very very high without any possibility to adjust it ,Negative
 We were in an annexe of the main hotel and had to walk out into the main road and back into the reception area The receptionists description of how to use the public underground car park was misleading and caused an hour of frustration The lift was swipe access from the road but inside the public car park anyone could travel to our floor The road outside was a bit shady after dark ,Negative
 the parking is easy and safe but rather expensive ,Negative
 a second chair in the room there was plenty of room would have been nice,Negative
 The bathroom is a little bit small Noise from restaurant reconstruction,Negative
 Hotel was a bit noisy Rate changed to more expensive when I extended the stay by one night ,Negative
 Our original room which was booked as a superior room with garden view was small we struggled to see any garden We asked for a larger room paid extra for this Hotel corridors were lengthy narrow not a 4 star impression ,Negative
No Negative,Negative
 Just the substitute breakfast arrangement but it was not a big deal Plenty of neighborhood alternatives ,Negative
 Parking is possible at the underground parking of the shopping center and is 15 euro day a little bit expensive ,Negative
 Very rude gentlemen at reception was just aiming to kick out people Hotel is close to a mall at nights things turn shady around the mall Bunch of youngsters create trouble ,Negative
 Very very unhappy experience The location is bad because it is a little far from center and the block gave us a uncomfortable feeling And the staff told us the air conditioner can not be used at the second night but we can use it the first day The breakfast is 16 euro one person but it is unworthy and the bed sheet is dirty and makes us feel very itching So we feel really angry ,Negative
No Negative,Negative
 We recently stayed at this property Eventhough it was March it was very hot in the room and the air conditioning was not working when enquired with the reception reply was to keep the windows open and sleep and the AC cannot be switched on for some reason Could not sleep the whole night due to sound from outside with the windows open some nearby construction happening at night When checked next day morning with the Manager available at the reception he gave some unacceptable excuses like this is a city hotel and not a one in the woods which basically meant that we have to suffer some noise levels and started arguing that there was no noise at night etc Finally provided a Fan for the next night Thank God we stayed only for 2 nights ,Negative
 The room we got and the room that was pictured on the website was NOT the same We just had a basic room with a futon set up like a bed for the kids There was no water boiler in the room for the advertised free coffee tea and hot chocolate I went to the front desk and was given a boiler with team only Of the staff I interacted with most were friendly ,Negative
 room was little bit dark no ceiling light and overlooked by a restaurant bar so we preferred not ot open the shuttles of the windows However it was absolutely OK for the purpose of our stay and even it feels cosy so no problems generally ,Negative
 The room was a bit more stark than I had anticipated We were given a room in the newer part of the hotel which was separate from the main entrance would have been more of an issue if we were staying there for breakfast ,Negative
 Internet was not always working queen sized bed is in reality two one person beds put together very warm in the room clima device was set on warm air ,Negative
 We had a standard room the covering of the floor and walls looks slightly outdated but clean Perhaps the rooms of a higher category have a more modern finishing In general we really enjoyed staying at the hotel ,Negative
No Negative,Negative
 cigarette smocking although it was not done inside the hotel somehow my room gets a lot of smoke from outside every time i opened my window ,Negative
 Woken every morning early by the cleaners talking to each other down the corridors very loudly no consideration for the hotel guests slamming doors etc Very warm in hotel all the time hard to sleep even with the heating off ,Negative
 The carpets in the rooms they should exchange it with better quality or remove them they cause a lot of dust alergie,Negative
 we were a couple and had requested a double bed however the hotel only had two separate beds,Negative
 Everything was fine ,Negative
 Getting there on car is not convenient as they do not have parking of their own I had to park the car at one of ride Park station and get train back to hotel which takes around 15 mins But you can park in Lunger City parking beneath hotel for 2 hours for free ,Negative
 No shower curtain in bath Also no tea or coffee making facilities in room We had asked for twin beds sofa but we were given 3 beds However the room had 2 armchairs so that was not an issue for us,Negative
 Booked a Superior Room for extra facilities such as mini bar coffee and kettle bath robes Sky TV garden view vase of fresh flowers etc Our room did not have any of the these When we spoke to the manager he said these facilities were not available in the hotel as all the rooms were standard On their website however they clearly advertise Superior Rooms at an extra cost A cost which we paid for When showing the manager the website of a Superior Room I was told that this was only for advertising No refund was offered but instead was told by the manager that if we want a kettle to pick it up from the bar If we want a drink in the room to go down four flights of stairs to the bar The garden view was a street of scaffolding with the hotel situated in the red light district They advertised the Superior Rooms with extra large double beds Our room had two single beds pushed together along with two single duvets Overall our room was tired in appearance bedside lamps did not work and what we paid extra for did not exist Atlantis Hotel is clearly under breach of false advertising Beware ,Negative
No Negative,Negative
 No tea and coffee making facilities in the room No view from the window ,Negative
 A C was not switched over yet so we slept with the windows open to cool the room We were on a pretty busy road Also had construction work happening around the hotel ,Negative
 Work being done on top of hotel Drilling and hammering from 0630 in the morning First room there was timber passing our window We got moved but 2nd room still noisy with drilling and hammering ,Negative
 i don t know how it could be improved as everything was perfect ,Negative
 They did not give me what they have promised Instead charged me for it ,Negative
 They did not have a double bed available and therefore ended up with 2 twin beds next to each other even though we had specifically asked for a double bed They insisted that 2 beds next to each other is equivalent to a double bed,Negative
No Negative,Negative
 I wish there were better restaurants and coffeeshops nearby ,Negative
 The 24 hour bar was closed on Sunday as the staff member was too cranky to serve beer after having a large party in before us which upset us,Negative
 Altough we booked a double room with one large bed we ended up with to twin beds Beds were not comfortable ,Negative
 Always a pity to have to pay extra for parking Such is life ,Negative
No Negative,Negative
 The room has a ventilation system that heats and cools the room at the same time It is very loud and it didn t heat the room enough Also the windows let in wind noise and cold air The hotel does not have a parking lot but it uses the Lugner gallery one ,Negative
 the location is not the best in vienna especially during the night ,Negative
 the twins beds should be bigger than are ,Negative
 The hotel is not very cozy and the beds are not super convenient ,Negative
 There was work being done on the building at the time of our stay around Advent The staff could ve warned us that we can expect pneumatic drill work from 7 30 AM ,Negative
 The hotel is excellent but its location alas is sad too many red light bars no decent restaurants within two long blocks radius ,Negative
No Negative,Negative
 Rooms are nowhere near soundproof there was noise from the hall street and other rooms the property completely ignored the 2 hour early Genius check in and for the location and price I would at least expect the breakfast to be included,Negative
 The breakfast it was very expensive so we didn t take it ,Negative
 Not safe position next to a U6 stop at night it was not nice coming back to the hotel room sharing a wall with the breakfast room very noisy when I had asked for a quite room even though I had a double bed they only provided me with one single duvet there was a big gap between the door and the floor allowing a lot of light to enter the room even at night ,Negative
 The bed was too narrow and short and I am not that large person It was not comfortable to sleep in The breakfast did not have enough meaty features I did not expect a dispenser in the bathroom in a 4 star hotel ,Negative
 Room was in other part of the hotel different building with its own entry kind of weird Bathroom floor around the shower cabin would be flooded after the showering probably the cabin was leaking somewhere In the morning it was very noisy due to the construction work in the building in which our room was situated Would start around 7 with the noise and drilling ,Negative
 Maybe little better signal of Wifi ,Negative
 Checkin was very slow and had to pay in advance Too expensive for what it has to offer but correct for Vienna ,Negative
 The heating could have been at a higher temperature in the bathroom as it is now November and a bit colder in the mornings ,Negative
 Check in receptionist lady Cost of parking Dirty walls on corridors Hospital feeling in staircase People on the streets of the neighborhood ,Negative
 This is not in any way by any stretch a 4 star hotel It is misleading to those booking it to claim that it is a 4 star it s like an old travel lodge which is totally fine if you know what you are getting but the rating description and pictures are not reflective of the quality of the hotel ,Negative
 The parking garage isn t connected to the hotel and was around a ton of constructions It was freezing and whenever we needed to go to the car lobby we had to exit the hotel and walk down the street Extremely inconvenient,Negative
 The breakfast was very good and comprehensive but if you wanted a light breakfast you could find better value at the supermarket next door We missed having a kettle in our room for a quick cuppa ,Negative
 Getting into the room is a nightmare you have to carry you luggage through multiple sets of stairs and for sure with no help from the hotel staff Then walk through multiple series of corridors for quieter a long distance Other than the rooms everything else is below three starts quality Including staff ,Negative
 I cannot see why this hotel can be rated with four stars The room was very average and the beds were separated in the middle It was a very average room and not at all what I expected I only slept over night however do not go here thinking it is a four star hotel The lobby is very small and I did not like the smell it smelled stale and maybe like smoke I would not reccomend this place due to the fact is is not a four star hotel maybe a three star ,Negative
 The pictures from booking was different from the room that we received The walls was dirty with shoe marks the expendable bed was not straight we sleep with our heads lower that out feet The price in these conditions was not fair ,Negative
 Staff did not know how to give directions to parking and second site which is not connected to main site because of construction We wandered the garage bumping into other people wandering the garage Very frustrating In the end we could not get our car out of the garage without getting staff to come to us Street blocked by construction Avoid until construction done and staff training updated ,Negative
 The staff was slow and not really friendly ,Negative
 Superior room didnt look somehow special I have awaited a bit more space and especially kings bed that wouldnt be just a fusion of two normal beds which kept moving apart that was bit dissapointing ,Negative
 There were noise of constriction They didn t provide us with hotel slipper The bed was twin beds connected to each other where i asked for queen bed ,Negative
 The TV does not have any English channels When checking in you receive specific cards for breakfast that you need to show to the personnel at the restaurant in our case there were a bunch of cards for 5 days of accommodation we received per couple 10 cards ,Negative
 Expensive breakfast but there is a very good bakery at the mall that I recommend Away from the center ,Negative
 I had to wait for 20 minuts in the lobby to be served I came late night around 11 pm It was dirty in the room glasses walls bathtube One of the beds what a simple mattress lying on the floor Lots of corridors with damaged dirty or missing lining For the price we have paid I would expect MUCH more ,Negative
 Hallways look institutional Breakfast is way over priced but with the mall right there other options that are better and more affordable are easily accessible ,Negative
 The hotel was a little further out of the cit centre then we anticipated but the transport connections made up for it ,Negative
 Nothing in particular Last day the elevator did not work for some hours but it sure can happen it was nobody s fault in particular so I won t blame anyone at the hotel for this little problem ,Negative
 a window s hinge was broken no sun blocking curtains on the window next to the bed and I ve been waken up every day by the morning sun expensive breakfast 14 ,Negative
No Negative,Negative
 Vacuum cleaning started too early in the morning in the apartment above us so we couldn t sleep 7 00 am is way too early for that Although our stay was comfortable and enjoyable we wouldn t rate the hotel as 4 stars unfortunately Also we couldn t get onto our balcony as it was impossible to open the shutters to gain the access we spent some time figuring it out but gave up in the end ,Negative
No Negative,Negative
 I ordered two double rooms standard B B When we arrived at the hotel we were asked to pay before entering the room that which seemed to me curious so I asked to see the room first We received two relatively small rooms near the hall serving breakfast From these rooms can feel good smells from the kitchen and hall mese In these conditions have asked us to provide other rooms after a little consultation we received two receptionists between rooms to another floor away from the dining room but had to pay an additional price I did not know this at the time when I ordered room on the internet When I asked where the parking lot I received explanations where is the entrance to the parking lot but looked to specify the parking area allocated to hotel guests parking is common with a large commercial complex that it has determined to seek about 15 minutes the area was reserved for hotel guests ,Negative
 outside of the hotel and halls are not very representative,Negative
 The entrance door was similar to an office and we had not a good impression on entry The user s guide of safe box was not apparently compatible with the safe box And a sentence on it that hotel accepts responsibility of safe box contents only up to Euros 500 forced us not to put our documents in there As they are more important for us compared with Euros 500 A gentleman in reception was not aware of our situation and our request for late checkout and disabled our keys at noon Although he politely fixed this ,Negative
 The parking is in the mall area and you can really get confused while reaching out to the hotel ,Negative
 Did think the breakfast was a little expensive Lift was small and slow ,Negative
 The neighborhood is really not a nice area We had a triple room which was sold as a room with double bed and a single bed At the end the single bed was a few sofa cushions on a wood board The long corridors at the 4th floor gave me the feeling of being in a hospital Definitely not worth 4 stars ,Negative
 AC was not initially working at all After the staff worked on it it only partially worked for the remainder of our stay ,Negative
 Bored staff loud and non controllable air condition room temperature controller out of order it was not 4 hotel it is only a 2 ,Negative
 Well at the breakfast situation was chaotic not enough waiters so too many dirty plates on the tables not enough food on the buffet table no clean plates all the time Only one waitress is not enough Only one elevator ,Negative
 Quality of the bed is terrible We asked for a queen bed and got two twins Not good if you are a couple Definetly not a 4 stars hotel max 3 ,Negative
 No room service no tea making facilities in room,Negative
 Parking garage is a little confusing ,Negative
 The hotel doesn t have a parking the one next to it is a private one which costs 15 euro day not included in the room price The minibar fridge was empty ,Negative
No Negative,Negative
 very close to the subway but it is not the best area to stay if you want to feel the Vienna old town overall room is clean and more business hotel I would say ,Negative
 a There was no restaurant inside the hotel So you could not have a lunch or a dinner inside the hotel except the breakfast b The main problem is that the area where the hotel is located is in the 15th district which is the worst one in Vienna Unfortunately we discovered this issue after having booked the hotel The hotel is located close to the West Train Station where at night time is dangerous I would not visit the hotel again only for the reason of the area where it is located c The wi fi was poor at the 3rd floor where we stayed,Negative
 For a one night stay there was nothing I didn t like except for the fact the part of the hotel we stayed in we had to walk up the street through road works with our luggage But I know you are in the middle of renovating and so really that is totally forgivable ,Negative
No Negative,Negative
 We were kept down the road in another building The reception was far away as was the dining room The air conditioner didn t work the first night and it took the receptionist 2 hours to vine to our room that too at midnight when we were dog tired The room was really tiny but this is Europe so I guess we can t expect much We had to plead for a kettle which was given very grudgingly An adapter to charge our phones was given very reluctantly too There were no glasses provided in the room to drink water Don t recommend this to any one 4 star they call themselves They re not more than 2 stars ,Negative
 When we checked in we found out that the air conditioning wasn t working We asked for the staff to fix it and they told us they would get it done in 2 days max The next time they came they toldus they weren t able to fix it They told us that we have a great room and that they didn t know why we were complaining It was rude and uncalled for even when we tried to explain that we simply expected what was written on their summary They then questioned critiqued us with where was this written ,Negative
No Negative,Negative
 We were a little concerned when we arrived as the area around the hotel didn t look great but if you turn right out of the hotel front door there is a small park area a few hundred yards along the road,Negative
 No advice about the hotel offres for the tour or the cruse The reception is far from the room location i have to walk on the street crossing construction i ask to get a taxi the receptiensit ask me to get one over the corner just to save the call staff said I ask for iron they said could we send it after half an hour i waited for 1 hour then i called again to get it,Negative
 Expensive and crowded parking Look of corridors and elevator Some stairs you have to lift luggage over Neigbourhood is not giving the feeling of security strange faces hang around in groups ,Negative
 First impressions Are that the area is a little shabby don t let that put you off as the area is very safe to walk around,Negative
 Mattress were a little bit too soft but I understand it s a subjective judgment ,Negative
 Staff could be more frendly I booked two rooms and specifically asked to be close at the end we got two rooms on different hotel wings No explanation ,Negative
 It would be OK for 3 star hotel but not for 4 We didn t have a hot water in the evening and for the staff it was normal just to say sorry we didn t know on time ,Negative
 We stayed in a building that was outside the hotel In the middle of the two buildings they are building the last part of the hotel so to go either for breakfast or reception we had to go outside Also the triple room that we booked was not the room that was given it was much smaller and after explaining the situation the staff gave us another double room ,Negative
 It is not that close to the old town but it is close to the metro ,Negative
 Location is not that good for tourist to go around the city such as visiting Schonbrunn and churches in city center but public transport can connect not a big deal,Negative
 The room was dirty even if I pay10 more because mine was not ready at my early arrival and receptionist proposed me to change it with a superior allready ready I forgot to tell them it was not cleaned well this one too,Negative
 The only fault if we were being very very picky is that there are no tea coffee making facilities in the room ,Negative
 No facilities for evening meals at hotel,Negative
 We booked room for 3 persons and were charged accordingly but third bed was an extra bed on floor Wasn t too comfortable ,Negative
 I was located in a remote part of the hotel you use the entrance of the undergroud car park to reach it in the different floors there are back entrances to offices and shops This is not pleasant I had the impression i am isolated not belonging to the hotel ,Negative
 We booked a room and the room they gave us was not the one in the pictures it was much worse it smelled and had only one small window After we complained they changed our room but still a bad experience ,Negative
 No free parking Overpriced breakfast Not convinient bus connection on the way back from the city centre pretty long walk in an ugly and dangerous area not pleasent in the evenings Very inconvinient design of the hotel huge labyrinth of endless corridors very inconvenient if you bring a dog with you There was hardly bearable odour from the canalisation in our room we were offered to change the room for the next night only as the hotel was fully booked for our first night there we were offered an air freshener tho Very limited english speaking tv channels offer Only one and very small elevator long waiting time as an alternative to carry your suitcases to and from 4th floor Lack of light blocking curtains Dirty and not safe neighbourhood ,Negative
 I ve requested an additional child bed to my booking but it was lost somewhere the staff was helpful and organized a three bed room for us quickly Thanks for the help ,Negative
No Negative,Negative
 No bad experience ,Negative
 very bad experience After I left the hotel I found out that my credit card has been charged without my authorization and without even telling me for an extra relevant amount of money for an asserted not defined damage they claimed we would have done in the room never again,Negative
 I didn t spend too much time on it but it seemed that the main lamp of the room and the reading lamps cannot be switched on and off separately and the heating cooling system is central i e cannot be controlled from the room ,Negative
 The curtain was a bit far from the window so there was a lot of light during the night early in the morning For a 4 hotel tea and coffee making facilities in the room would ve been nice ,Negative
 The fancoil unit from the room was noisy even if the fan was not functioning In the lobby of the hotel and around the entrance were a lot of strange Arab people the whole area seamed to be in a different part of the world not in Austria ,Negative
 It does not feel like a 4 star property Service was quite limited No minibar in room and limited room service Breakfast had limited spread and not worth the price ,Negative
 The matress was too soft for me so during the exhibition my back hurted Area is not the best but I experienced no problems ,Negative
 NesCafe not real coffee ,Negative
 No English tv channels No slippers bottled water iron box kettle ,Negative
 First we ve got a room where still were some repair works and staff did not know about it Of course we ve got another room but anyway it seems that one hand doesn t know what other does in this hotel ,Negative
 the Comfort room is too small not for a so called 4 stars hotel so called air conditioned was in fact a model of aerothermal cooling heating systems very noise ,Negative

 No real complaints the hotel was great great location surroundings rooms amenities and service Two recommendations however firstly the staff upon check in are very confusing regarding deposit payments and the staff offer you upon checkout to refund your original payment and you can make a new one Bit confusing Secondly the on site restaurant is a bit lacking very well thought out and excellent quality food for anyone of a vegetarian or vegan background but even a wrap or toasted sandwich option would be great Aside from those minor minor things fantastic spot and will be back when i return to Amsterdam ,Positive
 Location was good and staff were ok It is cute hotel the breakfast range is nice Will go back ,Positive

 Rooms were stunningly decorated and really spacious in the top of the building Pictures are of room 300 The true beauty of the building has been kept but modernised brilliantly Also the bath was lovely and big and inviting Great more for couples Restaurant menu was a bit pricey but there were loads of little eatery places nearby within walking distance and the tram stop into the centre was about a 6 minute walk away and only about 3 or 4 stops from the centre of Amsterdam Would recommend this hotel to anyone it s unbelievably well priced too ,Positive
 Style location rooms,Positive
 Comfy bed good location ,Positive

 Great onsite cafe Amazing building Park location Amazing Bobby Gin and Tonic ,Positive
 We loved the location of this hotel The fact that it is set in a Park away from the busy centre of dam square was great The tram system was brilliant and easy to handle The hotel is lovely and the bed was comfy Staff were very friendly and helpful and familiarized themselves with us when they realized we travelled from Ireland ,Positive
 Public areas are lovely and the room was nice but the window was broken and the drains in the bathroom smelt Its an old building and clearly has old building issues ,Positive
 I liked the hotels history And for such an enormous hotel I can t imagine how many girls were orphaned I liked their breakfast It was a quirky mix of fruits pastries meats and fish breads and the regular bacon and eggs Juices tea and coffee ,Positive
 Friendly staff OostPark a few yards away Good continental breakfast selection Quiet and relaxing area ,Positive
 The breakfast was the only positive element of this hotel original in taste and a good selection of selection of health food dishes on the buffet We did not try the restaurant but the whole set up with its view and terrace on the park is exceptional We had a wedding in the hotel s chapel so the convenience of just walking upstairs after the party was our reason of selecting this location ,Positive
 The location is good You need 15min to 20min walk to the center depends on your speed The hotel locates in a beautiful park and have a nice interior design The bed was really comfortable ,Positive
 Bed was extremely comfy and the staff where well spoken they also gave us all the help with easiest way to city centre and all the relevant transportation tickets and unique locations to visit will definitely be returning as this city is beautiful and the people are so friendly ,Positive
 Lovely hotel with extremely comfortable huge double bed We stayed in the split level room which we really liked If you have difficulty getting up stairs request if you can stay in a room all on one level The Oosterpark is beautiful the shops and restaurants are great with lots of variety to choose from You can get the Metro close by 8min walk or the Tram is a short walk away and runs from the station and you can get off within a 5 mins walk to the Hotel All in all a beautiful hotel with friendly staff shampoo and soap in the shower Tea and coffee facilities in your room and in a location that is more relaxing than the central Amsterdam We will be returning ,Positive

 The hotel itself is beautiful restaurant is very good and the adjacent park is gorgeous with beautiful birds and rabbits ,Positive
 The hotel is located in a beautiful old monastery building which has a special mood combined with all modern features There is a big park just opposite to the hotel Public transportation and a nice bakery for breakfast are also close Good wifi all around the hotel ,Positive
 The staff were so friendly and helpful plus the bar restaurant area is beautiful Located in its own park and the old building is simply stunning ,Positive
 Friendly staff The bar restaurant area is lovely and overlooks the park Very modern ,Positive
No Positive,Positive
 The hotel is going through renovations and unfortunately it means that the rooms can be less than perfect However the staff did recognise those shortcomings and did everything they could to make the stay as agreeable as possible ,Positive
 The room was very big spacious The bath tub was large enough for two people I love the axcess to the from multiple trams and trains The park location was amazing,Positive
 Very nice hotel manager he upgraded us because we had troubles with two different rooms They do everything to make you feel welcome and comfortable The park directly in front of the hotel is amazing rent a bike directly and make a tour Also the bathtub and bed is great ,Positive
 the building meeting rooms modern style of my room park,Positive
 Very nice hotel located in a park Ca 30 minutes by walk to the city center Not typical for Amsterdam since most city hotels are located in small buildings But pay attention to the fact that most of the rooms are two storeyed so you will have to use stairs to get to bed ,Positive
 The location was amazing the room was fantastic east access to public transport set on the lovely Oosterpark lots of places to eat and drink near by or nice walk to the main areas of Amsterdam I would definitely like to stay here again I only had breakfast at the restaurant on site and this was only once and fairly standard as A brit and a connoisseur of cooked breakfasts I was a little disappointed in the hot food but generally lots on offer for everyone just no where does a cooked breakfast like the English but very helpful staff and a nice place to sit with a coffee and start the day and this is the least of any worries due to their being so many good places to eat around and I personally prefer to wander and explore for my dining experiences But not qualified to give a true opinion of the restaurant it was certainly busy in the evenings which suggests its pretty good I will definitely be staying there again if possible the next time i take a trip to Amsterdam,Positive

 Anyways the staff was extremely friendly no complants there Location of the hotel is about 1km from the nearest metro station The rooms were tidy and the beds were good to sleep in However there where several small faulty details unfinished renovation in the room like lamp on the floor nails sticking out of floor which rips your sock etc so nothing major but adding them all together it makes this as a three star hotel in my opinnion ,Positive

 Generally clean and interestingly designed But a little worn Meanwhile there is massive renovation underway which will probably make it a much nicer hotel but in the meantime you will walk up a wooden ramp to reception and many amenities are in process The reason to stay here is that it s cheaper than other similar properties possibly because it s in renovation and also because it is off the beaten path though not in a bad neighborhood just not close to the hot spots ,Positive
 Architecturally the building is terrific you can feel the history of the place which just isn t there with purpose built chain hotels The Arena has the look and feel of a boutique hotel lushly decorated wrought iron work on staircases chandeliers the up lighting and high windows and ceilings gives a great sense of space Location is fab in the green space of Oosterpark but only a ten min walk to the City Halls The rooms are quirky with a small footprint THe ground level has a closet small sofa WC and shower fridge table and chair with the huge bed on a mezzanine level There s a tv on each level ,Positive

 this beautiful building has huge potential but you get the feeling that while the extention work is going on the hotel is less of a priority It is starting to look frayed at the edges But there is a good and funky atmosphere and the breakfast was very good The location was also perfect for us as we were visiting relatives nearby and it is also a quite airy part of amsterdam ,Positive

 Although the hotel is a little from the main centre the hotel itself was outstanding The hotel is currently under construction and expanding its capacity and restaurant bar space I was shocked when we arrived to see a construction site but you couldn t hear any building work from the room and the hotel was impeccable inside Fantastic value for money but I assume once the construction has been completed the hotel will be one of the top places to stay in Amsterdam The bar and restaurant is an added bonus to the hotel and the staff were pleasant and polite The hotel is spectacular and the rooms are modern and very comfortable the previous reviews regarding the bathroom walls are true but we didn t find that an issue I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone especially for the location as many trams lead to the centre of Amsterdam in only 7 10 minutes ,Positive

 Staff were indifferent and sullen I was given the impression the guests there were an inconvenience I left two personal items behind after checking out and after ringing on 9 seperate occasions speaking to several staff members and emailing supposed head of housekeeping I got nowhere not once did anyone ring me back even after promising everytime they would and I never heard from them about my items Ever They also gave me a 20 year old folding cot bed with a 1 mattress to sleep on for 3 nights I Would have thought 1000 plus for 3 nights would have afforded me a bed Yes I complained and they relented eventually Although the location is fantasticly placed I would never ever recommend this hotel to anyone in fact stay well away ,Positive

 Room was a nice size and very quiet Quite a long walk from reception along winding corridors but worth the walk when you got there We were in room 149 which was the very end room on a corridor and we never heard a thing ,Positive
 The hotel is in a quiet location right in the heart of London so it is within easy walking distance of most of the places we wished to visit We didn t experience the usual problem of banging doors and loud voices that seems to be the norm these days in big hotels maybe because we were right at the end of a corridor maybe because the walls and floors are well soundproofed so we managed to have a good undisturbed night s sleep There was very little traffic noise either It was lovely to be able to go to the local theatres and walk back to the hotel afterwards The Novello is a about 10 minutes walk away I loved the idea of the little duck it made it feel more personal and now sits in my bathroom at home The room we had was a good size the bed was extremely comfortable and the room was spotlessly clean A bath robe and slippers were provided as well as the usual toiletries ,Positive
